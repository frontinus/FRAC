eFRAC: eBPF Framework for Resource-Aware
Compression

Small abstract
Problem Statement. Wireless links exhibit strong bandwidth fluctuations
and sudden latency spikes due to interference, mobility, and hidden terminal
effects. Existing mechanisms either compress payloads or adapt traffic rate, but
none address the need for fast, fine-grained reaction at the network dataplane.
Header compression can reduce protocol overhead, but current approaches require static configuration and cannot respond dynamically to short congestion
events.
Research Gap. Header compression schemes (e.g., ROHC) are protocolspecific and must be configured a priori. Payload compression techniques (e.g.,
delta encoding, semantic/text compression) operate at the application layer and
react too slowly to transient congestion. No existing system is able to orchestrate
multiple compression techniques across layers and protocols, nor to dynamically
decide when header or payload compression should be applied based on real-time
wireless link conditions.
Contribution. We propose a framework that monitors packet sojourn time
inside the wireless dataplane and dynamically selects the optimal compression
strategy (header or payload). The decision logic executes in eBPF for submillisecond reaction, enabling cross-layer, multi-protocol adaptive compression
in response to instantaneous congestion signals.

Motivation and Related Work

Leggi questo: [1] They do they same stuff as ours but they dont do header
compression.
Leggi questo: [2] They do a static compression for both header and payload.
Important for Wireless background and testing methodologies.
Figure 2 successfully proves our hypothesis. The X-axis represents simulation time, and the Y-axis shows the queue level in MBytes. The red dashed line
at 0.05 MB is the total queue capacity, where packets begin to drop. The solid

lines show the mean performance over 50 runs, while the shaded areas represent
the 5%-95% confidence intervals.
We observe three distinct phases. In the first phase (0–8 seconds), all strategies perform identically, as no optimizations are active until the queue reaches
a 20% threshold (0.01 MB). In the second phase (8–40 seconds), the optimizations activate, and the lines diverge. The Baseline (Blue) fills rapidly, hitting
capacity around 38 seconds. Enabling HC (Orange) slows this process, buying
an additional 7 seconds. The HC + DPI strategy (Green) is the most effective,
as it both reduces packet size (HC) and drops redundant packets (DPI), delaying saturation until approximately 50 seconds. Finally, in the saturation phase
(after 50 seconds), all scenarios eventually fill the queue, confirming the goal is
to delay, not prevent, saturation. The HC + DPI strategy is the clear winner
in achieving this delay.

Plan for Thesis

What must be implemented:
• eBPF bandwidth estimation
• eBPF signaling
• eBPF policy for applying either header compression or payload compression
What should be taken from other repositories:
• header compression algorithms like RoHCv2 and some other.
• payload compression algorithms one audio to text and the other delta
encoding on coat. This can be simulated and can be taken from preprepared traces.
What could be added if there is more time:
• moving header compression logic in the kernel.
• create deep packet inspections for dropping repeated packets. With the
delta very small from the previous (for CoT or other types of services
similar)
• implementing the LLM transcription

Roadmap

First month: Bandwidth estimation (up to 15 Nov) Search for a bandwidth estimation approach that might work in the wireless environment and
can work on eBPF. Simulate the network with Mininet-Wifi, change the network bandwidth, and see how the bandwidth estimation react.
Second month: Sender Logic implementation (up to 15 Dec) Generate
a dataset for simulating payload compression. For example, an audio message
and its text version, in order to simulate a model compressing audio into text.
Or CoT simulates positions and creates delta encoding for the data. Write the
code to make a host send data at a specific frequency, and the eBPF hook to
make it change strategy.
Third month: Add header compression (up to 15 Jan) Add some
header compression schemes in the system so and make them work in the
userspace when signaled.

Fourth month: Testing policy (up to 15 Feb) Study what policy to apply
since the dynamic of the compression is different. Header compression is faster
to react but can drop more slowly. Payload compression reacts more slowly, but
the drop can be significant.
Fifth month: Testing in software, possibly also hardware. (up to 15
March) Inject the code on hardware devices (Raspberry + antennas) and
obtain real measurements. Get plots and significant measurements. Plot ideas:
• How the system is influenced by different policies: graph of bandwidth of
the link/ time and the data rate from the sender.
• How good the bandwidth estimation is: Telemetry measurement/Bandwidth
• How many packets are we saving?: Against no compression, payload compression, and payload compression + header compression.
Sixth month: write thesis (up to 15 Apr)

Write the thesis.

Figure 1: Architecture of the eFRAC system, illustrating the interaction between user-space components and the eBPF-enabled kernel, the dashed lines
represent the typical flow of the system with the functionnalities implemented
by eBPF. 1. (Normal Operation) The applications running in the user space
of a terminal produce data and need to send it to at least another terminal
over the network, they can directly send it over the network while it’s not under attack. From the receiver’s perspective it receives it. 2 and 3. (Degraded
Flow) When the network is under attack or operating in conditions that reduce
its available bandwidth it can compress the quantity of data it sends over the
network through Delta Encoding or LLM Transcription (for images or videos),
when reaching the receiver that data is transcripted back to the original message
without losing key informations by achieving a high semantic similarity. 4.Data
is sent or received over the network, when received it must transit through decompression (if we’re operating with a low bandwidth) before being sent to the
application. Furthermore we also receive out of band dedicated signaling packets, that get handled by an eBPF program which uses the network data received
from the signaling to adapt its encoding behavior. 5. In the middlebox’s kernel
we host eBPF programs that operate Signaling, Forwarding, Bandwidth estimation and Deep packet inspection services over the network. Produced control
plane packets are sent over the nodes of the network. 6. When the network is
under attack the packets are forwarded to the user space to have their headers
compressed depending on what kind of packet they are.
